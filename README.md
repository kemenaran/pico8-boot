This code reproduces the pico8 boot animation on a Game boy Color.

Implementation
==============

The boot animation is composed of 6 frames.

Each frames changes the color of many pixels â€“ but the palette itself never changes (it is a fixed set of 14 colors).

To achieve the effect:

- On each line (hblank), the palettes are partially updated to reflect the colors of the next scanline
  _This allows to display 4 colors per 8x1 line (instead of 4 colors per 8x8 block)._
- On each frame (vblank), the BG tile data is updated with the new pixels.

Issues
======

- It takes a while to load the tileset and tilemap.
 That's ok: the animation is fast, but still has several frames of pause between each frame, during
 which we can transfer data.

- On the original boot animation, somes 8x1 lines feature 5 differents colors (4 colors + black backround). The GBC is limited to 4 colors per 8x1 line.
 That's ok: shifting the original image by row_count + [0,1,2,1,0] pixels yields a vertical image that
 has maximum 3 different colors per pixel. It also makes the image repeating horizontally, which helps to reduce the number of tiles and palettes. The hblank interrupt just needs to scroll to the correct position though.

- Although we can change the palette or tile attributes on each scanline, each 8x1 line would need to pick one of the 8 available palettes. So all 16 pixels blocks on a line would need to share 8 palettes.
 That's ok: we can mirror the image horizontally, so that's one palette for each 8 8x1 line.


Hardware infos:
- We can change up to 24 consecutive colors per scanline:
  - 24 with a fully hardcoded slide
  - 20 with a popslide
- We can change up to 13 colors with random access per scanline
- We can change up to 9 color pairs (18 colors total) with random access per scanline
 - 18 with a fully harcoded slide
 - 16 with a popslide

=> We can change the first 2 colors of each palette on every scanline \o/
 (The first two colors are variable, then comes the palette dominant color and the color black, which never change.)

Clues :

- For more colors per 8x1 block: add sprites to work around this
- Use the GBC screen remanence to display more colors
- Change the Y-scroll during scanline rendering, for more color (https://github.com/LIJI32/GBVideoPlayer/blob/master/How%20It%20Works.md)

Transforming the original image:
1. Copy the first column of pixels to the last, to restore symetry    ;
2. Translate the image by 1px, for tiles to be aligned to a 8x8 grid  ; both reduce cases of 5 colors per 8x1 to 4
3. Crop half of the image, and duplicate it on render (reduce number of palettes per scanline from max 16 to max 8)
4. Rotate the original artwork by row_count + [0,1,2,1,0] every line, and back-correct by changing the X-scroll of 1px during HBlank. It reduces reduce cases of 4 colors per 8x1 to 3.

- What if we alternate between two different BG map on each scanline? Would that reproduce the "two images merged together" look of the original pictures?

Images conversion:
- `convert 1.small.png +dither -colorspace Gray -colors 4 -depth 4 1.bw.png`
- `rgbgfx original-gfx/4-colors/1.bw.png --unique-tiles --tilemap gfx/1.bw.tilemap --output gfx/1.bw.tileset.2bpp`
- `rgbgfx gfx/3.bw.tileset.png --reverse 16 --output gfx/3.bw.tileset.2bpp`

Status
======

The demo is implemented and works (tested using the BGB emulator).

Future work:

- Curbe-adjust the colors, to match a real GBC screen
- Let the linker auto-organize the code into sections (instead of specifying them manually)
- Test on other emulators
- Restart the animation when pressing a button
- Slow-animation mode
- Frame-by-frame mode
